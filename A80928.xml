            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118070:3"/>very many, and muſt needs be ſo, becauſe the Diſpute was long and very near at hand, and often at Puſh of Pike, and from one defence to another; there are about Six or ſeven thouſand priſoners taken here, &amp; many Officers and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen of very great quality, Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and divers other Noblemen, I hear the Earl of <hi>Loutherdail,</hi> many Officers of great quality, and ſome that will be fit ſubjects of your Juſtice: We have ſent very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Parties after the Flying Enemy; I hear they have taken conſiderable numbers of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and are very cloſe in the Purſuit: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I hear the Countrey riſeth upon them every where, and I believe the Forces that lay through Providence at <hi>Bewdley,</hi> and in Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and Staffordſhire, and thoſe with Colonel <hi>Lilburn,</hi> were in a Condition as if this had been foreſeen, to intercept what ſhould return.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118070:3"/>was about Sixteen thouſand ſtrong, and fought ours on <hi>Worcester</hi> ſide of <hi>Severn</hi> almoſt with their whole, whileſt we had engaged half our Army on the other ſide but with parties of theirs; In deed it was a ſtiff buſineſs, yet I do not think we have loſt Two hundred men: Your new raiſed Forces did perform ſingular good Service, for which they deſerve a very high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and acknowledgement, as alſo for their willingneſs thereunto, foraſmuch as the ſame hath added ſo much to the reputation of your Affairs; they are all diſpatched home again, which I hope will be much for the eaſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Countrey, which is a great Fruit of the Succeſs.
